	<p>Every image taken comes from an angle. So, you cannot take a photo without having to consider angles to some degree. Taking photos from the standard front-facing angle gives good results. But, let's try to spice things up and get creative with our angles. Making that small decision can wield big results.

   <h2>So how do you know which angles are best?</h2> 
	<h2>How do you take photos from those angles?</h2>
<p> Well, that's what this page is all for! 
</p>
</article>
<article class="item"> 
	<p>First, there are an endless amount of angles for you to choose from. But we can simplify that into basic angles that are good places to start from. </p>
    <h2>1. Bird's Eye View</h2>
	<p>Here's an example:</p>
	<img src="birdseye.jpg" alt="bird's eye view of a forest and a road pathway" width="500" height="338" class="photos">
	
	<p>As you can see, it consists of a direct shot that's looking down at your subject matter. This shot can be good for landscapes or photos that tell a narrative/scene. This can be hard to achieve though, especially if you want it high up. You might need more than a camera to reach that level (like a drone?). 
</p>

	<h2>2. High Angle</h2>
	<p>Examples:</p>
	<img src="romhigh.jpg" alt="Photo of model sitting down in the sun" width="300" height="659">
	<img src="romhigh2.jpg" alt="Photo of model laying down in the sun" width="300" height="659">
	<img src="romhigh3.jpg" alt="Photo of model relaxing down in the sun" width="300" height="659">
	
	<p>This is a lowered version of a bird's eye view angle. More so, it's when the camera is closer to the subject matter, and the angle is at a higher point. Like when it's closer to their head. Choosing this angle makes the model look smaller. It also creates a unique sense of proportion. 
</p>
    </article>
	<article class="item"> 
		<h2>3. Low Angle</h2>
	<p>Example for your perusal: </p>
	<img src="romlow.jpg" alt="model looking down at the camera smiling" width="450" height="307">
		<img src="romlow2.jpg" alt="model looking down at the camera" width="200" height="307">
	
	<p>This shot is when you take the photo below the subject's eye level. This can communicate confidence and power, since it makes the subject appear larger. Since they are looking down at the viewer, it sort of creates a power dynamic. 
</p>
</article>
	<article class="item"> 
		<h2>4. Front-facing</h2>
	<p>Example: </p>
		<img src="pree.jpg" alt="portrait of model smiling at camera">
<p>This angle is great for your typical portrait! To put it in more simple terms, it can create a connection between the model and viewer. It can also be very intimate and close if that's what you desire for your photo. To achieve this shot, it is best to take it from the subject's eye level.
